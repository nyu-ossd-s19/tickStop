Our goal is to have a harassment free environment. We believe everyone should behave 
professionally and respectfully. This is a judge free workplace where people with all
kind of different skill levels are welcome. We want to implement a welcoming community
that is a safe and helpful community for everyone, regardless of experience, gender 
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size,
race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality. We will not tolerate any intimidation or
disrespect towards differences of opinion.
